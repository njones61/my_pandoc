OK, I am trying to convert a word doc to latex and then put it in he mdpi format. See the *.tex file in the gwbase_manuscript_07          
  subfolder. make a copy of this file and convert it to the MDPI format in the MDPI_Article_Template folder. Preserve teh contents of       
  the gwbase file, but make the layout and styles, formatting etc match the MDPI template.   


NOTE: After conversion, you need to put the new mdpi-formatted *.tex file, the media subfolder, and the Definitions subfolder into a
 single zip archive for uploading to prism.
